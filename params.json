{"name":"Ash","tagline":"Experimental terminal based IM client in Ruby (Campfire only, for now)","body":"# Ash\r\n\r\nAn experiment to build a terminal based IM client. Currently, only a Campfire adapter is implemented, but the idea is to support multiple backends. Scope `vendor/ash-campfire` to get the idea.\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress, but the Campfire implementation is solid enough to use. Check out the walkthrough below for some screenshots.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* Ruby 2.0+ (probably 1.9 too, but not tested)\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n* Clone the project\r\n* Copy `ash.yml.example` to `~/.ash.yml`, and set `subdomain` and `token` for Campfire\r\n* Install dependencies with `bundle install`\r\n* Run with `bin/ash`\r\n\r\n## Walkthough\r\n\r\nType `:help` and hit return to show a full list of commands:\r\n\r\n![](http://cl.ly/image/2X0A0Z1J2T0w/content)\r\n\r\nType `:rooms` to show a list of rooms (as per your config YAML file):\r\n\r\n![](http://cl.ly/image/290w1R0w2k1t/`content)\r\n\r\nJoin room 1 by typing `:room 1`:\r\n\r\n![](http://cl.ly/image/2B143q1F100o/content)\r\n\r\nList people in the current room with `:people`:\r\n\r\n![](http://cl.ly/image/3x0F3Y0F021q/content)\r\n\r\nType messages and hit return to post. You can clear the screen buffer at any time, type `:clear`:\r\n\r\n![](http://cl.ly/image/1I0W1l1a1E2e/content)\r\n\r\nSwitch to room 2 with `:room 2`:\r\n\r\n![](http://cl.ly/image/3z0N0v0H0L0p/content)\r\n\r\nYou can switch back to room 1 with `:room 1`:\r\n\r\n![](http://cl.ly/image/1M18353o3m2Z/content)\r\n\r\n## Contributions\r\n\r\nContributions very welcome!
